CHANGELOG

2.3.1 (05/25/2025)
- Added support for Dynamic Waypoints, that keep a Waypoint at the highest position on the y-axis
- Fix for 1.21.5 release, thanks to datatags on Github

2.3.0 (08/17/2024)
- Update for 1.21 release, built using Java 17
- Minor fixes to Waypoint saving and recipe removing

2.2.11 (02/08/2024)
- Added ability to globally disable menu being shown when walking over Waypoints (config:
  Waypoints.SHOW_MENU_ON_WALK)
- Added ability to configure when a beacon is consumed (in config: either menu or teleport, now defaults to
  teleport)
- Minor coding changes for 1.20

2.2.10 (12/12/2021)
- Minor changes for 1.18 release

2.2.9 (05/03/2021)
- Added command to open Waypoints Directory using /wp open command, wp.open permission. This is designed for
  server admins to link with additional plugins rather than player usage, but can also be used as a player
  perk if desired.

2.2.8 (04/05/2021)
- Fix for error appearing when interacting with hotbar

2.2.7 (02/07/2021)
- Add config option to prevent menu at spawn point appearing without permission
- Fix for icons that aren't items being allowed to be set on Waypoints through the icon command (which breaks
  the plugin)

2.2.6 (01/21/2021)
- Added command to receive permanent beacon using /wp beaconperm command, wp.spawn.beacon permission. Player
  must also have wp.beacon.unlimited and the permanent beacon flag be enabled. This command follows the rules
  of permanent beacons in that if a player already has a beacon, they will not be given one; however it
  ignores the permanent beacon world whitelist and will work in all worlds.

2.2.5 (01/16/2021)
- Added ability to set the icon in config to use for shown discoverable waypoints

2.2.4 (01/14/2021)
- Added support to have beacons be enchanted books. This is to offset issues with compass beacons being
  interfered with on 1.16 due to lodestones. Book beacons can be activated in the config, have a separate
  crafting recipe, and can be used whether you encounter issues with the previous beacons or not!
- Added ability to set worlds that permanent beacons are assigned on.
- Added ability to set permanent beacons as immovable when assigned to a hotbar slot and the player is not
  creative.
- Fixed the issue where the mouse would reset while navigating categories when the menu size was set to
  resize.

2.2.3 (01/02/2021)
- Added support for NBT Tags being added to items for integration with plugins that require NBT tags to
  identify items.

2.2.2 (12/31/2020)
- Added ability to set beacon's preferred slot when plugin assigns a player a permanent beacon.

2.2.1 (12/29/2020)
- Added ability to choose different warp effects during transportation (in config, options are: blaze, bubble,
  ender, nether, quiet, thunder)

2.2.0 (12/24/2020)
- Server Waypoints can now be categorised using the new Category commands. Categories can have their own icons,
  can be ordered, and can be set upon multiple Waypoints, providing submenus for these Waypoints.
- Added ability to show discoverable waypoints (set in config).
- Added to have hints on shown discoverable waypoints.
- Added command to receive beacon using /wp beacon command, wp.spawn.beacon permission
- Added ability to resize Waypoint Menu (in config, options are: compact, small, medium, large, max, resize)
- Fix for Waypoints containing full stops in name being wiped out.
- Fix for invalid Spawn Mode set in config wiping out waypoints.
- Fix for `wp.access.*` permission not working as intended.
- Fixes to Messages and Permissions.

2.1.4 (11/21/2020)
- Beacons can now prevent waypoints activating while walking when you have them in your inventory. This does
  not affect waypoints that you discover.
- Plugin tells users how many home waypoints they can freely make, and that waypoints will be replaced when
  this is filled.
- Added missing messages to the Message Config (note if you update Waypoint Beacon name or lore, existing
  beacons will stop working).

2.1.3 (06/12/2020)
- Added flag to allow the bed to be included when respawning using Home Spawn mode
- Added checks to ensure the world exists before teleporting a player

2.1.2 (05/19/2020)
- Bug fix for when interacting with Waypoints while holding an item in your offhand and not in your main hand

2.1.1 (05/11/2020)
- Rewritten movement management code to prevent bugs where the Spigot server ignores resetting these back to
  their proper values, leaving a player stranded with only jump powers
- Added update checking code
- Changelog now back to US style dates (as a Brit, this hurts!)

2.1.0 (03/10/2020)
- Waypoints are now saved in YAML instead of Java Serialization which makes for a much nicer storage
  mechanism
- Home Waypoints can now be moved using an identically named Clock
- Home Waypoints can now be renamed and removed using compasses while sneaking; a named compass right-clicked
  on an existing home waypoint while sneaking will rename that waypoint, while an unnamed compass left-clicked
  on an existing home waypoint while sneaking removes it.
- Listed all permissions in plugin definition so they would visibly autocomplete in permission editors such as
  LuckPerms when adding/removing permissions
- Bug fixes to prevent teleporting into walls or obstructions and to center teleport locations to the middle
  of a block instead of the edge
- Bug fixes for dealing with accessing waypoints under half blocks like carpet or slabs
- Bug fix for a rare occasion where a server shutdown during teleportation would end up with a player unable
  to move correctly

    Players with "wp.bypass" permission will still be able to travel to disabled waypoints
- Added item "Waypoint Beacon"; recipe is a compass in the center of a workbench surrounded by redstone
    Players with the permission "wp.beacon.use" can right-click while holding it to open directory
    "wp.beacon.server" will allow players to see server-defined waypoints with the beacon

    "/wp discover" will toggle discovery mode for selected waypoint
        "Server-wide" will allow discovered waypoints to show up globally
        "World-specific" only allows discovered waypoint to show in its own world
        "Disabled" disables discovery mode
        Accessing waypoints in discovery mode will grant players access to it; disabled by default
- Instead of scaling and being capped at displaying 54 waypoints, directory is now a fixed size
    Added paging and navigation buttons in directory to allow for an unlimited number of waypoints
- Fixed bug that allowed player to drop items from directory under rare circumstances

1.0.0 (06/30/2014):
- Waypoint icons can now have durability values
- Waypoint access permissions changed to use an underscore in place of spaces
    Ex. "&6The Nether" would have a permission of "wp.access.the_nether"
- Stopped waypoint menu from opening for waypoint locations which the player doesn't have access
    Menu always opens at spawn, but players need "wp.access.spawn" for it to show up in other menus

- Right-clicking with a renamed clock (through anvil) while sneaking will create a home waypoint
- Right-clicking on a home waypoint while sneaking will set the waypoint's icon to player's item in hand

0.9.2 (06/27/2014):
- Waypoint names and descriptions now have configurable length limits; menu lore now wraps as needed
